# Bioacoustic Unit has developed an app using Epicollect that allows technicians to enter their visit and other metadata while in the field to supplement paper.

```{r}

library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

cID<-"2431" # client ID
secret<- "" # client secret
proj.slug<- "bu-aru-visits" # project slug
form.ref<- "aru-deployment" # form reference

#Create a POST request to authorize 
res <- POST("https://five.epicollect.net/api/oauth/token",
            body = list(grant_type = "client_credentials",
                        client_id = cID,
                        client_secret = secret))
                        
#Make sure everything is connected
http_status(res)

#Create the token - I suppose you could just also do this withint the GET request. 
token <- content(res)$access_token

# Create the url to access the data - I'm using a JSON format here. 
url.form<- paste("https://five.epicollect.net/api/export/entries/", proj.slug, "?map_index=0&form_ref=", form.ref, "&format=json", sep= "")

# Get the data from the project
res1<- GET(url.form, add_headers("Authorization" = paste("Bearer", token)))

# Make sure it worked
http_status(res1)

# Create a list 
ct1<- fromJSON(rawToChar(content(res1)))

# Next will be formatting everything to WildTrax standard...
