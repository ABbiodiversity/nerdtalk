# GitHub pages and static websites

In this session we'll talk about different template engines and GitHub pages. 
 
GitHub pages is a nice and free ($0) option for hosting static (JAMstack style) websites. 
It uses markdown based jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) for templating, but can host any static content, 
e.g. based on pkgdown (https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/), blogdown (https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), bookdown (https://bookdown.org/).
 
After an overview, we will concentrate on bookdown as the lowest barrier option for creating manuals for various projects.
